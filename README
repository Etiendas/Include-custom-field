This is a shortcode that lets you include RAW html inside posts from its custom fields.
To use, create a custom field in the post (ex: "my table") and put this in a WP post:
	[include "my table"].
	
If needed, you can perform global includes from other posts this way:
	[include global="my table"]

Warning/extra feature: shortcodes can be recursive. If you have these custom fields:
	Name	Value
	"One"	First sentence.
	"Two"	Second sentence.
	"Three"	Test [include one two] ing.

Putting [include three] in a WP post will produce:
	"Test First sentence. Second sentence. ing."
